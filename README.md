# Exercice

Solve the following question using RScript, part of the R programming language.  We do not expect you to currently know any R, so before your interview please learn enough R to use it to write an answer to the following question.


Bring your completed answer along to your interview ready to demonstrate - you will be expected to explain it and modify it a little during the interview.  You will have access to a web browser / Google as you are doing this.


Given a CSV file of the form:


operationtype,starttime,endtime

find,1,5

find,3,8

delete,2,9

find,4,6

update,1,8

delete,7,11


please output the Max, Min, Mean and Median duration for each operation type using RScript. Times are in seconds. Feel free to add more rows or operation types to the sample data set above.


# Result

If I don't put print() function on the reducers, the program crash.

Very curius
